# The Ultimate Time Waster

## Description

The Ultimate Time Waster is a hilariously frustrating mobile game where the goal is seemingly simple: watch a counter go up. However, there's a catch! Any movement of your phone – a tap, a shake, even a slight tilt – will immediately stop the counter. It's a true test of patience and a fun way to troll yourself and your friends.

## How to Play

1.  Open the app.
2.  The counter will start incrementing.
3.  Keep your phone *absolutely still*.
4.  If the phone moves at all, the counter stops.

## Monetization

The game uses ads to monetize. You can watch an ad to earn a 5-minute cooldown period where you are allowed to move your phone without stopping the counter.
